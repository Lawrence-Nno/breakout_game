# BREAK OUT GAME
### A python Turtle's Rendition

In line with my resolve to further explore the Python's different GUI libraries. I decided to code the classic breakout game which was initially designed by Steve Wozniak, based on conceptualization from Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, who were influenced by the seminal 1972 Atari arcade game Pong.

## Tech:
This game was built using:
- Turtle Library
- Python
